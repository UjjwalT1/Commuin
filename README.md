It is an Android Application in which the members belonging to a common organization will be connected to each other . This app aims to provide a
separate communication channel for the employees and members of the organization. There be a different account for the Organization and its Members. ( Eg:
For a college the members can be Teaching Staff , Managing Staff and Students etc.. ).

The organization account will be responsible for setting up the details that which member belong in the organization. This account can also post information on organizationâ€™s behalf.
The members account will be connected to the organization . Members can only create their account with the organization if the organization account has stored their
records in the application database.

This is a Jetpack Compose Project and Its purely limited to the firebase features such as Firestore,RealtimeDB , Storage . 
Its still not production ready . As authenitication performed in this application are just bare minimum to be called authentication. Eg: Password is fetched locally to verify instead on server side because I didnt used Firebase funcion.
